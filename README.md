# CV Parser Documentation Repository

This repository demonstrates **AutoFlow's documentation-driven development process** for the CV Parser project (cvparse.demosrv.uk).

## What This Repository Contains

This is a **documentation snapshot** created by AutoFlow BEFORE any code was written. It showcases how AutoFlow generates comprehensive technical documentation from a simple product specification, which then serves as the blueprint for implementation.

### Documentation Structure

## The AutoFlow Documentation-Driven Development Process

### Phase 1: Documentation Generation (What's Shown Here)

Starting from a basic product idea, AutoFlow's `/make-docs` command generated:

1. **Product Documentation** - User personas, feature prioritization, user journeys
2. **Functional Specifications** - Detailed business rules and acceptance criteria
3. **Architecture Design** - System components, technology choices, integration patterns
4. **API Specifications** - Complete REST API design with schemas
5. **Security Framework** - Threat models and security controls
6. **Testing Strategy** - Multi-level testing approach with coverage targets
7. **Deployment Plan** - Infrastructure and operational procedures
8. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** - 12 key technical decisions with rationale

### Phase 2: Sprint Planning (Not in This Repo)

From these documents, AutoFlow creates:
- Task breakdown with effort estimates
- Sprint organization (15h max per sprint)
- Dependency mapping
- Acceptance criteria per task

### Phase 3: Implementation (Not in This Repo)

Using the documentation as a blueprint, AutoFlow:
- Implements features following TDD approach
- References specific documentation sections
- Validates against acceptance criteria
- Ensures architectural compliance

## Key Features of This Documentation

### Comprehensive Coverage

Every aspect of the system is documented before a single line of code is written:

- **User Experience**: Who will use it and how
- **Technical Design**: What to build and why
- **Implementation Guidance**: How to build it correctly
- **Quality Assurance**: How to verify it works
- **Operations**: How to deploy and maintain it

### Decision Traceability

The 12 ADRs document critical technical decisions:

- Why Express instead of alternatives?
- Why stateless architecture?
- Why adapter pattern for LLM integration?
- Why multi-stage Docker setup?
- Why no authentication?

Each decision includes context, considered alternatives, and rationale.

### Implementation-Ready

Documentation includes:

- API request/response examples
- Data schemas and validation rules
- Error handling strategies
- Security requirements
- Performance targets
- Testing requirements

## The AutoFlow Advantage

### Traditional Approach

```
Idea → Code → Documentation (if you're lucky) → Refactor → More code → ???
```

Problems:
- Architecture emerges accidentally
- Inconsistent patterns
- Missing security considerations
- Poorly documented decisions
- Technical debt from day one

### AutoFlow Approach

```
Idea → Comprehensive Docs → Validated Architecture → Clean Implementation → Working System
```

Benefits:
- Architecture designed upfront
- Consistent patterns enforced
- Security built-in from start
- All decisions documented
- Technical debt minimized

## How AutoFlow Used These Documents

When building the CV Parser, AutoFlow:

1. **Referenced specific sections** during implementation
   - Building file upload? → Read `docs/FUNCTIONAL.md#file-upload`
   - Implementing LLM integration? → Read `adrs/0001-adapter-pattern-for-llm-integration.md`
   - Setting up Docker? → Read `adrs/0005-multi-stage-docker-hot-reload.md`

2. **Validated against acceptance criteria**
   - Each task included specific acceptance criteria from `FUNCTIONAL.md`
   - Tests verified compliance with requirements
   - No feature was "done" until criteria were met

3. **Ensured architectural consistency**
   - All code followed patterns in `ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - Security controls from `SECURITY.md` were implemented
   - API matched specifications in `API.md`

## Project Overview

**CV Parser** is a web application that transforms unstructured CV documents into structured, machine-readable data using Large Language Models.

### Key Features

- Upload CV files (PDF, DOCX)
- AI-powered parsing with multiple providers (Ollama, OpenAI, AWS Bedrock)
- Structured data extraction (personal info, skills, education, experience)
- Job title recommendations
- JSON export
- No authentication required (stateless architecture)

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **LLM Integration**: Adapter pattern supporting multiple providers
- **Document Processing**: pdf-parse, mammoth
- **Infrastructure**: Docker (multi-stage), Traefik reverse proxy
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E)

## Exploring the Documentation

1. **PRODUCT.md** - Understand the vision and user needs
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - See the high-level system design
3. **ADRs/** - Learn about key technical decisions

### For Different Roles

**Product Managers**:
- Read `PRODUCT.md` for features and success metrics
- Check `FUNCTIONAL.md` for detailed requirements

**Developers**:
- Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design
- Check `API.md` for endpoint specifications
- Review ADRs for technical decisions
- See `TESTING.md` for test strategy

**DevOps Engineers**:
- Read `DEPLOYMENT.md` for infrastructure
- Check `adrs/0005-multi-stage-docker-hot-reload.md` for Docker setup
- See `adrs/0011-external-traefik-reverse-proxy.md` for routing

**Security Engineers**:

- Check `adrs/0012-no-authentication-strategy.md` for auth decisions
- Review privacy considerations

## What's Not Here

This repository contains **only the documentation**. The following were generated in later phases:

- Source code implementation
- Test suites
- Sprint plans and task tracking
- Docker configurations
- CI/CD pipelines
